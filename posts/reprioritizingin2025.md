# Dropping from Gies iMBA
Although I normally like to finish what I started, I've evaluated that the Gies iMBA is no longer suitable for my medium to long term plans. The learnings are good to have, but the learning opportunity cost is high and it does not align with my dream of working on my side hustles. Furthermore, due to certain terms and conditions in the reimbursement policy at the company I work for, the company has decided not to reimburse the tuition fees; the company only reimburses funds for 1masters program, and I've already used this benefit for my MS CS at Georgia Tech. 

For 2025, I intend to pursue an AI certification for my current career, the Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification for my personal development, and work on getting better at NextJS with [**https://luncheonmeet.app**](https://luncheonmeet.app). 

# 2025 New Year Resolution
My 2025 new year's resolution includes:
- Achieve my 12th straight Gold in IPPT (Indiviudal Physical Proficiency Test)
- Get CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) Certified
- Complete an AI Technical Course
- Complete [**https://luncheonmeet.app**](https://luncheonmeet.app)
- Spend more quality time with family

# The Luncheon Meet App
The idea comes from my everyday question of who to eat lunch with. I'm thankful that I do not face this problem at my current workplace because we have team members who always eat together, but I've always remembered the days when it was awkward to message people to organize a lunch group. 

After speaking to my peers, I've observed similar ideas such as finding people to hike with on a solo vacation, or finding people to potentially found a startup with. This app is built to be flexible enough to accomodate these use cases too. 

Though this app may not be refined enough to serve the target user base, it will serve as a stepping stone towards better built projects.
