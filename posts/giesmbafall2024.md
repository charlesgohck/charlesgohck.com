# Review: BADM508 Leadership and Teams
This course goes over some of the common themes that are important in leadership and teams in organizations. For example, it covers the importance of diversity and inclusion, and about doing our part in fostering a sense of psychological safety in the workplace, which is important if we are to create an environment where people can voice their concerns easily. 

The course also examines the importance of self-development and the relationships between the self and other individuals as well as between the self and the organization. It asserts that while pursuing our goals, we have to watch out for signs of burnout and take care of our wellbeing because our effectiveness at work indirectly or directly affects the rest of our team. 

I was particularly intrigued by the team Everest Simulation Exercise, which simulated a team effort to reach the top of the Everest mountain. After the exercise, the takeaway was that instead of thinking too much about reaching the top as a whole team, we should have analyzed the true underlying goals behind each individual character to better optimize how many people should have reached the top together versus how many people should have stayed at a base camp; forcing all characters to reach the top together turned out to not only be hazardous to some characters but also cause us to miss out on points derived from meeting individual goals. I suppose this is applicable at work. While it is important to inspire our team members to work towards a shared goal, it is also important to examine what each of us are motivated by so we can better organize our efforts. 

# Review: BADM509 Managing Organizations
Managing Organizations had two parts to it: designing the organization, which was about creating the mission, vision, and culture of the team, and managing the organization, which is about maintaining a good culture, managing change, etc. It was quite helpful to acquire some knowledge about how to look at an organization from a organizational perspective. It was also very useful to reach the different case studies about how real-life organizations managed change and implemented cultures, conventional and not. 

I was quite surprised that I quite liked the matrix organizational structure, which is a combination of the functional and the divisional organizational structure; i.e. it combines groupings of employees based on domain specialty and based grouping sbased on service departments. I think it is because while I liked to be able to find the knowledge I need from the functional structure at work, I appreciated the divisional way of organizing resources to achieve goals at the workplace. 

For our team project, we analyzed Visa as a company and its response to potential disruptors from the rational, natural, and open system perspective. Rational perspective is all about how to best organize resources to achieve a goal. Natural perspective is all about the interactions between humans in the organization. Open system perspective is all about the interactions between the organizations and outside forces. Overall, the project was a good recap of the course material.

# Review: MBA597 Program Foundations
This was a mandatory course that ensured that all students knew about the various resources available. It served as a helpful reminder. 

# Personal Project: Learning NextJS
To keep my skills relevant, I am finding time here and there to work on my next NextJS project. The skills will be transferable to my work and will help me keep up to date with public cloud administration and web development.
