# Dropping from Gies iMBA
I've evaluated that the Gies iMBA is no longer suitable for my medium to long term plans. The learnings are good to have, but the learning opportunity cost is high and it does not align with my dream of working on my side hustles. Furthermore, due to certain terms and conditions in the reimbursement policy at the company I work for, the company has decided not to reimburse the tuition fees; the company only reimburses funds for 1 masters program, and I've already used this benefit for my MS CS at Georgia Tech. 

For 2025, I intend to pursue an AI certification, the Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification for my personal development, and work on getting better at the NextJS tech stack.
