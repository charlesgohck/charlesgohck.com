# Tech Updates
There are several changes to the blog since I last worked on the technical side of things.

Firstly, I've made the blog entries more compact so that users don't have to scroll too quickly. 

Secondly, I've included a tag filter, which users can interact with to filter by topic. 

Lastly, I've included a client side search box, which makes use of debouncing to search for keywords in the blog. Debouncing puts less stress on the client device. 

# Using a CMS
I've decided to use Wisp as the content management system for my blog. This allows me to update the blog on the go without committing code. 

# Source Code
